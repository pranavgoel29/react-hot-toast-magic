Add the Toaster to your app first. It will take care of rendering all notifications emitted. Now you can trigger \`toast()\` from anywhere!

```jsx
import toast, { Toaster } from 'react-hot-toast-magic';

const notify = () => toast('Here is your spicy toast.');

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={notify}>Make me a spicy toast</button>
      <Toaster />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Why React Hot Toast Magic?

While `react-hot-toast` has been a fantastic choice for many, the decision to create React Hot Toast Magic was driven by a desire for more functions, increased spiciness, and the need for more frequent updates. If you've been looking for a notification library that goes the extra mile, React Hot Toast Magic is here to meet those expectations.

## Enhanced Toasts - Info and Warning
React Hot Toast Magic introduces additional toast types such as `info()` and `warning()`, providing more options for your notifications.
